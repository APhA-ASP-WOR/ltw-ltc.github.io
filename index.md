Welcome to my website! We are currently under construction. Much of what is found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liam-weston-ee/) will be followed up on this website a bit more indepth. 


### Projects
Projects I have thoroughly enjoyed

- The design of the matching network for a [Vivaldi Antenna](/Project/VivaldiAntenna.md)

- My SDP where my team was in the midst of building a revolutionary version of [Acoustic based Battleship](http://www.ecs.umass.edu/ece/sdp/sdp20/team05/) intended to appeal to college students 

This site is written in markdown, the following contains formatted templates for various useful editing tools
